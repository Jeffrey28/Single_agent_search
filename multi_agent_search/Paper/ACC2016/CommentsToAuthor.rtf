Chair review:\
\
This paper covers a technique for the estimation of the\
environment using multiple UGVs with a Bayesian filtering\
method.  Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol is used to\
disseminated the measurements among the UGVs.  The\
introduction presents a clear overview of the history and\
need of the estimation methods.  The LIFO-DBF algorithm is\
explained in detail with its equations and simulation\
results are given.  The results show the estimate of the\
distance to the target converging to the target's position\
after multiple distributed estimations.\
Figures 3 and 4 need to be explained in more details to\
give more information for average knowledge readers. The\
conclusion need to address the findings of the work done\
and not be a duplicate of the abstract.\

Comments to the author\
======================\
\
The paper presents a distributed Bayesian filtering method\
for a network of multiple UGVs under dynamically changing\
interaction topologies. Latest-In-and-Full-Out protocol is\
used in which each UGV is broadcast observations to its\
neighbors by using single-hopping.\
The paper is well written and organized, however there are\
some points need to be addressed. The authors claimed that\
"the main benefit of using LIFO is on the reduction of\
communication burden with the transmission data volume\
scaling linearly with the UGV number". 
\b This claim is not\
shown in the manuscript and not compared to existing\
methods to prove the reduction of communication burden
\b0 .\
\
Another point to mention, 
\b Figures 3 and 4 need to be\
explained in more details
\b0  to give more information for\
average knowledge readers.\
\

\b The conclusion need to address the findings of the work\
done and not be a duplicate of the abstract.

\
The paper is recommended for publication after addressing\
reviewer comments.}
