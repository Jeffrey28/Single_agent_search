	\begin{abstract}
		
		This paper presents a distributed Bayesian filtering (DBF) method for a network of multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under dynamically changing interaction topologies. The information exchange among UGVs relies on a measurement dissemination scheme, called Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol. Different from statistics dissemination approaches that transmit posterior distributions or likelihood functions, each UGV under LIFO only sends a buffer that contains latest available measurements to neighboring nodes, which reduces the transmission burden from the order of environmental size to that of UGV number. 
		Under the condition that the union of undirected switching topologies
%		 across some time intervals
		is connected frequently enough,
%		 as system evolves,
		LIFO can disseminate observations over the network within finite time. The LIFO-based DBF algorithm is then derived to estimate individual posterior density function (PDF) for target localization in a static environment. The consistency of this algorithm is proved that each individual estimate of target position converges in probability to the true value when the number of observations tends to infinity.
		The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by a series of simulations.

	\section{INTRODUCTION}
	%Section II: Topology + LIFO + Proof

	%Section IV: Simulation
	
	Unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) that operate without on-board operators have been used for many applications that are inconvenient, dangerous, or impossible to human. Distributed estimation using a group of networked UGVs has been applied to collectively infer status of complex environment, such as intruder detection \cite{chamberland2007wireless} and object tracking \cite{wang2003online}. Several techniques have been developed for distributed estimation, including distributed linear Kalman filters (DKF) \cite{2005distributed}, distributed extended Kalman filters \cite{madhavan2004distributed} and distributed particle filters \cite{gu2007distributed}, etc. The most generic filtering scheme is distributed Bayesian filters (DBF), which can be applied for nonlinear systems with arbitrary noise distributions \cite{bandyopadhyay2014distributed,julian2012distributed}.
	This paper focuses on a communication-efficient DBF for networked UGVs.
	
	The interaction topology plays a central role on the design of DBF, of which two types are widely investigated in literature: fusion center (FC) and neighborhood (NB). In the former, local statistics estimated by each agent is transmitted to a single FC, where a global posterior distribution is calculated at each filtering cycle \cite{zuo2006bandwidth,vemula2006target}. In the latter, each agent individually executes distributed estimation and the agreement of local estimates is achieved by certain consensus strategies \cite{jadbabaie2003coordination,ren2005consensus,olfati2007consensus}. In general, the NB-based distributed filters are more suitable in practice since they do not require a fusion center with powerful computation capability and are more robust to changes in network topology and link failures. So far, the NB-based approaches have two mainstream schemes according to the transmitted data among agents, i.e., \textit{statistics dissemination} (SD) and \textit{measurement dissemination} (MD). In the SD scheme, each agent exchanges statistics such as posterior distributions and likelihood functions within neighboring nodes \cite{hlinka2013distributed}. In the MD scheme, instead of exchanging statistics, each agent sends its observations to neighboring nodes. 
	
%	The pioneering work of statistics dissemination scheme can date back to the 80s of last century \todohere{reference}. 
%	Later, \todohere{reference} have considerably advanced the study of this scheme in the field of distributed estimation. 
	Statistics dissemination scheme has gained increasing interest and been widely investigated during last decade.
	Madhavan et al. (2004) presented a distributed extended Kalman filter for nonlinear systems \cite{madhavan2004distributed}. This filter was used to generate local terrain maps by using pose estimates to combine elevation gradient and vision-based depth with environmental features. Olfati-Saber (2005) proposed a distributed linear Kalman filter (DKF) for estimating states of linear systems with Gaussian process and measurement noise \cite{2005distributed}. Each DKF used additional low-pass and band-pass consensus filters to compute the average of weighted measurements and inverse-covariance matrices. 
%	Sheng et al. (2005) proposed a multiple leader-based distributed particle filter with Gaussian Mixer for target tracking \cite{sheng2005distributed}. Sensors are grouped into multiple uncorrelated cliques, in each of which a leader is assigned to perform particle filtering and the particle information is then exchanged among leaders. 
	Gu (2007) proposed a distributed particle filter for Markovian target tracking over an undirected sensor network \cite{gu2007distributed}. Gaussian mixture models (GMM) were adopted to approximate the posterior distribution from weighted particles and the parameters of GMM were exchanged via average consensus filter. 
	Hlinka et al. (2012) proposed a distributed method for computing an approximation of the joint (all-sensors) likelihood function by means of weighted-linear-average consensus algorithm when local likelihood functions belong to the exponential family of distributions \cite{hlinka2012likelihood}. Saptarshi et al. (2014) presented a Bayesian consensus filter that uses logarithmic opinion pool for fusing posterior distributions of the tracked target \cite{bandyopadhyay2014distributed}. Other examples can be found in \cite{julian2012distributed} and \cite{beaudeau2012target}. 
%	Generally, this scheme can be further categorized into two types: leader-based and consensus-based. In the former, statistics is sequentially passed and updated along a path formed by active UGVs, called leaders. Only leaders perform filtering based on its own measurement and received measurements from local neighbors \cite{sheng2005distributed}. In the latter, every UGV diffuses statistics among neighbors, via which global agreement of the statistics is achieved by using consensus protocols \cite{olfati2007consensus,ren2005consensus,jadbabaie2003coordination}. 
	
	
	Despite the popularity of statistics dissemination, exchanging statistics can consume high communication resources. 
	One remedy is to approximate statistics with parametric models, e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model \cite{sheng2005distributed}, which can reduce communication burden to a certain extent. 
	However, such manipulation increases the computation burden of each agent and sacrifices filtering  accuracy due to approximation.
	The measurement dissemination scheme is an alternative solution to address the issue of exchanging statistics. 
	An early work on measurement dissemination was done by Coates et al. (2004), who used adaptive encoding of observations to minimize communication overhead \cite{coates2004distributed}. Ribeiro et al. (2006) exchanged quantized observations along with error-variance limits considering more pragmatic signal models \cite{ribeiro2006bandwidth}.
	A recent work was conducted by Djuric et al. (2011), who proposed to broadcast raw measurements to other agents, and therefore each agent has a complete set of observations of other agents for executing particle filtering \cite{djuric2011non}.  A shortcoming of aforementioned works is that their communication topologies are assumed to be a fixed and complete graph that every pair of distinct agents is constantly connected by a unique edge. In many real applications,the  interaction topology may change dynamically due to unreliable links, external disturbances and/or range limits \cite{xiao2008asynchronous}.
%	The communication links between UGVs may be unreliable due to disturbances or communication range limitations. 
%	If the information is being exchanged by direct sensing, the locally visible neighbors of a vehicle will likely change over time. 
	In such cases, dynamically changing topologies can cause random packet loss and variable transmission delay, thus decreasing the performance of distributed estimation, and even leading to inconsistency and non-consensus. 
	
	This paper presents a measurement dissemination-based distributed Bayesian filtering (DBF) method for a group of networked UGVs with dynamically changing interaction topologies. The measurement dissemination scheme uses the so-called Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol, in which each UGV is only allowed to broadcast observations to its neighbors by using single-hopping.
	Individual Bayesian filter is implemented locally for each UGV after exchanging observations using LIFO.
	Under the condition that the union of undirected switching topologies is connected frequently enough, two properties are achieved: (1) LIFO can disseminate observations over the network within finite time; (2) LIFO-based DBF guarantees the consistency of estimation that each individual estimate of target position converges in probability to the true value as the number of observations tends to infinity. 
	The main benefit of using LIFO is on the reduction of communication burden, with the transmission data volume scaling linearly with the UGV number. 
	
	The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
	The LIFO protocol for dynamically changing interaction topologies is formulated in \cref{sec:lifo}.
	The LIFO-based DBF algorithm is described in \cref{sec:LIFO-dbf}, where the consistency and consensus of estimation are proved.
	Simulation results are presented in \cref{sec:sim} and \cref{sec:conclu} concludes the paper.
	
	\section{LIFO Protocol for Dynamically Changing Interaction Topologies}\label{sec:lifo}
	Consider a network of $N$ UGVs in a bounded two-dimensional space $S$. 
	The interaction topology can be dynamically changing due to limited communication range, varying team formation or link failure.
	Each UGV is equipped with a sensor for environmental perception. 
	Due to the limit of communication range, each UGV can only exchange sensor observations with its neighbors. 
	The Bayesian filter is run locally on each UGV based on its own and received observations via single-hopping to estimate the position of a static target in $S$.
	
	\subsection{Graphical Model of Interaction Topology}
	%The UGV network is always assumed to be connected, i.e., there exists a path, either direct or indirect, between every pair of UGVs.
	%Under this assumption, consider an undirected and fixed graph 
	Consider a simple\footnote{An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is \textit{simple} if it has no self-loops or repeated edges, i.e., $\left( i,j\right)\in E,\,\text{only if } i\neq j$ and $E$ only contains distinct elements. A graph is \textit{connected} when there is a path between every pair of vertices in $V$.}, undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ to represent the interaction topology of N networked UGVs, where $V=\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace $ represents the index set of UGVs and $E=V\times V$ denotes the edge set. 
	The \textit{adjacency matrix} $M=\left[ m_{ij}\right] $ of graph $G$ describes the interaction topology:
	\small\begin{equation*}
		m_{ij}=\begin{cases}
			1& \text{if}\;\left(i,j\right)\in E\\
			0& \text{if}\;\left(i,j\right)\notin E
		\end{cases},
	\end{equation*} \normalsize
	where $m_{ij}$ denotes the entity of adjacency matrix. 
	The notation $m_{ij}=1$ indicates that a communication link exists between $i^\text{th}$ and $j^\text{th}$ UGV and $m_{ij}=0$ indicates no communication between them.
	\cref{fig:com_topo} illustrates three types of typical topologies: ring \cite{lawton2003decentralized}, line \cite{liu2010simple}, and star \cite{thatte2008sensor}. 
	All of them are represented by simple and undirected graphs.
	
%	The interaction topology can be dynamically changing due to limited communication range, varying team formation or link failure.
%	Let $\bar{G}=\left\lbrace G_1,G_2,\dots,G_L\right\rbrace $ denote the set of all possible simple and undirected graphs defined for the network of UGVs.
	Let $\bar{G}$ denote the set of all possible simple and undirected graphs defined for the network of UGVs.
	It is easy to know that $\bar{G}$ has finite elements.
	The adjacency matrix associated with a graph $G_l\in\bar{G}$ is denoted as $M^l=[m^l_{ij}]$.	
	Define the \textit{union} of a collection of graphs $\left\lbrace G_{i_1},G_{i_2},\dots,G_{i_l} \right\rbrace \subset \bar{G}$ as the undirected graph with nodes in $V$ and edge set given by the union of edge sets of $G_{i_j},\,j=1\dots,l$.
	Such collection is defined to be \textit{jointly connected} if the union of its members forms a connected graph.
	
	We define two concepts of neighborhood in a UGV network.
	The \textit{direct neighborhood} of $i^\text{th}$ UGV under topology $G_{l}$ is defined as $\mathcal{N}_i(G_{l})=\left\lbrace j|m^l_{ij}=1,\,j\in\left\lbrace1,\dots,N \right\rbrace \right\rbrace $. 
	All UGVs in $\mathcal{N}_i(G_{l})$ can directly exchange information with $i^\text{th}$ UGV via single-hopping.
	In addition to direct neighborhood, another set called \textit{available neighborhood} is defined as $\mathcal{Q}_i(G_{l})$, which contains indices of UGVs whose observations can be received by the $i^\text{th}$ UGV given a specific observation exchange protocol and the interaction topology $G_{l}$. 
	Note that in general $\mathcal{N}_i(G_{l})\subseteq\mathcal{Q}_i(G_{l})$.
	%but when only single-hopping is allowed, $\mathcal{N}_i=\mathcal{Q}_i$.

	\subsection{Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) Protocol}\label{subsec:LIFO}
	%This study proposes a Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol for observation exchange and derives two corresponding distributed Bayesian filtering (DBF) algorithms, shorted as LIFO-DBF. 
	%The data communication in LIFO uses synchronized step as the execution of DBF.
	%In each step, LIFO only allows single-hopping communication within the direct neighborhood, but is able to broadcast observations of each UGV to any other agents after a finite number of steps.
	%The individual PDF is forward predicted and updated in DBF after each LIFO cycle.
	%The theoretical analysis show that LIFO-DBF can ensure the consistency and consensus of distributed estimation while requiring much less communication burden than statistics dissemination-based methods. 
	This study proposes a Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol for observation exchange.
	Under LIFO, each UGV contains a communication buffer (CB) to store its latest knowledge of observations of all UGVs: 
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_k=\left[ z^1_{k^i_1},\dots,z^N_{k^i_N}\right]
	\end{equation*}
	where $z^j_{k^i_j}$ represents the observation made by ${j^\text{th}}$ UGV at time $k^i_j$. 
	Note that under LIFO and certain conditions of interaction topologies, $\mathcal{Q}_i=\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace \setminus \left\lbrace i\right\rbrace$, which will be proved in \Cref{cor1}.
	$z^j_{k^i_j}$ is stored in the CB of ${i^\text{th}}$ UGV, where $k^i_j$ is the latest observation time of ${j^\text{th}}$ UGV that is available to ${i^\text{th}}$ UGV by time $k$. Due to the communication delay, $k^i_j<k, \forall j\neq i$ and $k^i_i=k$ always holds.
	Let $G[k]\in\bar{G} $ represent the interaction topology at time $k$. 
	The \textbf{LIFO protocol} is stated in \cref{alg:lifo}.
	For the clarity of explanation of DBF in \cref{sec:LIFO-dbf}, we define a \textit{new observation set} $\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k$ for $i^\text{th}$ UGV to denote the set of observations that the $i^\text{th}$ UGV receives and stores in its CB at $k$.

	\begin{rem}
		Compared to statistics dissemination, LIFO is generally more communication-efficient for distributed filtering. 
		To be specific, consider a $D\times D$ grid environment with a network of $N$ UGVs, the transmitted data of LIFO between each pair of UGVs are only the CB of each UGV and the corresponding UGV positions where observations were made, the length of which is $O(N)$. 
		On the contrary, the length of transmitted data for a statistics dissemination approach that transmits unparameterized posterior distributions or likelihood functions is $O(D^2)$, which is in the order of environmental size. 
		Since $D$ is generally much larger than $N$ in applications such as target localization, LIFO requires much less communication resources.

%	\todohere{change the figure to be a switching topology. change the contents here accordingly}
	\cref{fig:LIFO} illustrates the LIFO cycles of a network of 3 UGVs with switching line topologies.
	There are two types of topologies: under the first one only UGV $1$ and UGV $2$ can directly communicate and under second one only UGV $2$ and UGV $3$ can directly communicate.
	Several facts can be noticed in \cref{fig:LIFO}: 
	(1) the two topologies are jointly connected within each time intervals $\left[0,3 \right) ,\,\left[3,5 \right) ,\,\left[5,7 \right)$;
	(2) CBs of all UGVs are filled within $5$ steps;
%	, which means under LIFO each UGV has a maximum delay of 2 steps for receiving observations from other UGVs; 
	(3) after being filled, each CB keeps updated every finite time steps, which means each UGV receives new observations of other UGVs with finite delay.
	Extending these facts to a network of $N$ UGVs, we have the following proposition:
	%\medskip

		\label{fig:LIFO}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{prop}\label{prop1}
		%For a fixed and undirected network of $N$ UGVs, LIFO uses the shortest path(s) between $i^\text{th}$ and $j^\text{th}$ UGV to exchange observation, the length of which is the delay $\tau_{i,j}$ between these two UGVs.
		Consider a network of $N$ UGVs with undirected switching interaction topologies.
%		\todohere{may rephrase the following sentence}
		If the following two conditions are satisfied:
		(1) there exists an infinite sequence of time intervals $\left[k_m,k_{m+1} \right),\,m=1,2,\dots$, starting at $k_1=0$ and are contiguous, nonempty and uniformly bounded;
		(2) the union of graphs across each such interval is jointly connected,
		then arbitrary pair of UGVs can exchange observations under LIFO. In addition, the delay between each pair of UGVs is no greater than \small$(N-1)T_u$\normalsize, where \small$T_u=\sup\limits_{m=1,2,\dots}\left( k_{m+1}-k_m\right) T$ \normalsize is the upper bound of interval lengths.
	\end{prop}
	
	\begin{proof} 
		%Without loss of generality, assume that there is a unique shortest path between $i$ and $j$, denoted by $T^{j,i}_{n^*}=\left(v_1,\dots,v_{n^*}\right)$, with $v_1=j,v_{n^*}=i,v_{m+1}\in\mathcal{N}_{v_m}$. 
		%Then, the distance between $i$ and $j$ is $d(j,i)=n^*-1$. 
		%The following mathematical induction will prove \Cref{prop1}.
		%
		%Step (1): When $d(j,i)=1$, $j\in\mathcal{N}_i$ and $j$ can directly send $z^j_k$ to $i$. Then $z^j_k$ is stored in $i^\text{th}$ CB at time $k+1$, i.e. $\tau_{i,j}=1$. 
		%\Cref{prop1} holds for $d(j,i)=1,\,\forall i,j\in\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace $.
		%
		%Step (2): Suppose that \Cref{prop1} holds for $d(j,i)=s,\,s\geq 2,\,\forall i,j\in\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace$. 
		%Then for $d(j,i)=s+1$, i.e., $n^*=s+2$, by the Bellman's principle of optimality, the path $T^{j,l}_{n^*-1}=\left(v_1,\dots,v_{n^*-1}\right)$ is a shortest path between $j$ and $l$, where $v_{n^*-1}=l$ and $i\in \mathcal{N}_l$. 
		%The assumption that \Cref{prop1} holds for $d(j,i)=s$ implies that $z^j_k$ is received and stored in $l^\text{th}$ UGV's CB at time $k+s$. 
		%Since $i\in\mathcal{N}_l$, $i^\text{th}$ UGV receives $z^j_k$ at $k+s+1$. 
		%For any other path $T^{j,i}_{n}=\left(v_1,\dots,v_{n}\right)$ with $n>n^*$, $z^j_k$ cannot be received by $i$ earlier than $k+s+1$. 
		%Therefore $\tau_{i,j}=s+1$. 
		%This proves the \Cref{prop1} for $d(j,i)=s+1$.
		Consider the transmission between two arbitrary UGVs, $i$ and $j$.
%		 $i^\text{th}$ and $j^\text{th}$ UGV.
		%Without loss of generality, we focus on the transmission of $z^i_0$, the observation at time $0$ by $i^\text{th}$ UGV.
		Since the union of graphs across time interval $\left[k_1,k_2 \right)$ is jointly connected, $i^\text{th}$ UGV can directly communicate with at least one another UGV at a time instance, i.e., $\exists l_1\in V,\,t_1\in \left[k_1,k_2 \right)$ such that $i\in\mathcal{N}_{l_1}(G[t_1])$.
		This implies that observation $z^i_{t_1}$ is received and stored in the CB of $l_1^\text{th}$ UGV at $t_1+1$ under LIFO.
		Therefore, at least one UGV other than $i^\text{th}$ UGV has received and received observation from $i^\text{th}$ UGV by $k_2$.
		If $l_1=j$, then we have proved the exchange of observations between $i$ and $j$.
		If $l_1\neq j$, we consider time interval $\left[k_2,k_3 \right)$.
		By using similar derivation as before, it is easy to understand that $\exists l_2\in V,\,t_2\in \left[k_2,k_3 \right)$ such that $i\in\mathcal{N}_{l_2}(G[t_2])$ or $l_1\in\mathcal{N}_{l_2}(G[t_2])$.
		For the former case, $z^i_{t_2}$ is received and stored in the CB of $l_2^\text{th}$ UGV at $t_2+1$ under LIFO;
		for the latter case, $z^i_{t_1}$ is received by $l_2^\text{th}$ UGV at $t_2+1$ but may not be stored in its CB.
		This happens if $l_2^\text{th}$ UGV has received a newer observation $z^i_{t^\prime_2},\,t_1<t^\prime_2<t_2$, from UGVs other than $l_1$.
		In both cases, at least two UGVs have received and stored an observation from $i^\text{th}$ UGV by $k_3$.
		Using similar derivation, it can be shown that all $N-1$ UGVs, except $i^\text{th}$ UGV, will receive and store an observation from $i$ no later by $k_{N}$.
		Therefore, the transmission delay between an arbitrary pair of UGVs is no greater than \small$(N-1)T_u$\normalsize.

	\subsection{Probabilistic Model of Binary Sensor}
	%In this paper, distributed Bayesian filter is used to estimate the true target position by a network of binary sensors.
	In this study, each UGV is equipped with a binary sensor, which only gives two types of observation: $1$ if the target is detected, and $0$ if no target is detected. 
	The observation of $i^\text{th}$ sensor at $k^\text{th}$ time step is denoted as $z^i_k$.
	% and subjects to Bernoulli distribution $B(1,p_{i,k})$.
	The likelihood function that the target is detected is
	%The following likelihood function gives the probability for $i^\text{th}$ sensor to obtain $z^i_k$:
	%\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bin_sensor}
	%	P(z^i_k|x^T_k;x^R_k)=p^{z^i_k}_{i,k}(1-p_{i,k})^{1-z^i_k},
	%\end{equation}\normalsize
	%where $p_{i,k}=P(z^i_k=1|x^T_k;x^R_k)$; $x^T_k$ and $x^R_k$ denote the target and UGV position at $k$, respectively.
	\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bin_sensor1}
	P(z^i_k=1|x^T;x^{R,i})\in \left[0,1\right],\; x^T\in S,
	\end{equation}\normalsize
	where $x^T$ denotes the target position; $x^{R,i}$ is the position of $i^\text{th}$ UGV.
	%; $X^T$ represents the set of all possible target positions.
	Correspondingly, the likelihood function that no target is detected is
	\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bin_sensor0}
	P(z^i_k=0|x^T;x^{R,i})=1-P(z^i_k=1|x^T;x^{R,i}).
	\end{equation}\normalsize
	%\Cref{eqn:bin_sensor} actually defines a binary sensor model parameterized by $x^T_k$ and $x^R_k$.
	
	The combination of \Cref{eqn:bin_sensor1} and \Cref{eqn:bin_sensor0} forms a binary sensor model parameterized by $x^T$ and $x^{R,i}$. 
	For the purpose of simplicity, we will not explicitly write $x^{R,i}$ when no confusion may occur.
	%, with which all observations are generated. 
	The commonly used likelihood functions for binary sensor include Gaussian function \cite{bonnie2012modelling} and step function \cite{djuric2008target}.
	
	\begin{rem}
		Given the knowledge of current target and UGV positions, current observation of each UGV is conditionally independent from its own past observations and those of other UGVs.
	\end{rem}
	
%	\begin{rem} 
%		The proposed LIFO protocol 
%		%to be described in \cref{sec:LIFO-dbf} 
%		is applicable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous binary sensors. 
%		A homogeneous model can simplify the analysis of LIFO-based DBF, while a heterogeneous model is more close to real sensing characteristics.
%		In addition, it also works for other types of sensors, such as laser scanners and cameras.
%	\end{rem}	
	
	\subsection{Distributed Bayesian Filter for Multiple UGVs}\label{subsec:dbf}
	
	The distributed Bayesian filter (DBF) using LIFO protocol is introduced in this section.
	%, which is also stated in \cite{bandyopadhyay2014distributed} and \cite{julian2012distributed}. 
	Each UGV has its individual estimation of posterior density function (PDF) of target position, called \textit{individual PDF}. 
	The individual PDF of $i^\text{th}$ UGV at time $k$ is defined as
	% ,z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k})
	\small$P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})$\normalsize, where $\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k}$ denotes the collection of new observation set by $i^\text{th}$ UGV from time $1$ to $k$.
	%and by UGVs in $\mathcal{Q}_i$ that have been stored in CB of $i^\text{th}$ UGV by time $k$.
	%from time $1$ through $k$ and $z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k}$ means the set of observations by UGVs in $\mathcal{Q}_i$ that are transmitted to $i^\text{th}$ UGV.
	%Note that if the observation by $j^\text{th}(j\in \mathcal{Q}_i)$ UGV at time $k'(k'\leq k)$ is not received by $i^\text{th}$ UGV, the corresponding element $z^j_{k'}$ in $z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k}$ is empty and thus not utilized for computing $i^\text{th}$ individual PDF.
	The individual PDF is initialized as \small$P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_0)=P(x^T)$\normalsize,
	%$P^i_{pdf}(x^T_0|z^i_0,z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_0)=P(x^T_0)$, 
	given all available prior information including past experience and environmental knowledge. Under the framework of DBF, the individual PDF is recursively estimated using Bayes' formula, based on observations of $i^\text{th}$ UGV and that of UGVs in $\mathcal{Q}_i$.
	
%	\subsubsection{Prediction}
%	%The $i^\text{th}$ individual PDF at time $k-1$ is known, denoted as $P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})$. 
%	%At time $k$, the prior individual PDF $P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})$ is first predicted forward by using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:
%	At time $k$, the prior individual PDF $P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})$ is first predicted forward by using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:
%	%\small\begin{align}\label{eqn:bayes_pred}
%	%&P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})\notag\\
%	%&=\int P(x^T_k|x^T_{k-1})P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})dx^T_{k-1}
%	%\end{align}\normalsize
%	\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bayes_pred}
%		P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})
%		=\int P(x^T_k|x^T_{k-1})P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})dx^T_{k-1}
%	\end{equation}\normalsize
%	where $P(x^T_k|x^T_{k-1})$ is a Markov motion model of the target, independent of UGV states. 
%	This model describes the state transition probability of the target from a prior state $x^T_{k-1}$ to posterior state $x^T_k$. 
%	Note that the target is static in many search applications, such as the indoor search for stationary objects \cite{kulich2014single}. 
%	For a static target, its Markov motion model is simplified to be
%	\small\begin{equation*}
%		P(x^T_k|x^T_{k-1})=\begin{cases}
%			1 & \text{if}\; x^T_k=x^T_{k-1}\\
%			0 & \text{if}\; x^T_k\neq x^T_{k-1}
%		\end{cases}.
%	\end{equation*}\normalsize
%	%and \Cref{eqn:bayes_pred} can be reduced to $P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k}|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})=P^i_{pdf}(x^T_{k-1}|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})$.
%	This work focuses on the localization of static target.
%	Therefore, we remove the subscript of $x^T_k$ for the rest of the paper.
	
%	\subsubsection{Updating}
	To be specific, at time $k$, the $i^\text{th}$ individual PDF is updated using the set of newly received observations $\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k$:
	%\small\begin{align}\label{eqn:bayes_upd}
	%&P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|z^i_{1:k},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k})\notag\\
	%&=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})P(z^i_k|x^T_k)\prod\limits_{j\in\mathcal{Q}_i}P(z^j_k|x^T_k)
	%\end{align}\normalsize
	%\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bayes_upd}
	%P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k})
	%=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k-1})P(z^i_k|x^T_k)\prod\limits_{j\in\mathcal{Q}_i}P(z^j_k|x^T_k)
	%\end{equation}\normalsize
	%\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bayes_upd}
	%P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})
	%=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})P(\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k|x^T_k)
	%\end{equation}\normalsize
	\small\begin{align}\label{eqn:bayes_upd}
		P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})
		&=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})P(\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k|x^T)\notag\\
		&=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})\prod\limits_{z^j_{k^i_j}\in \mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k}P(z^j_{k^i_j}|x^T)dx^T.
	\end{align}
	where $K_i$ is a normalization factor, given by
	%\small\begin{align*}
	%K_i=1/\int P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|z^i_{1:k-1},z^{\mathcal{Q}_i}_{1:k-1})P(z^i_k|x^T_k)\prod\limits_{j\in\mathcal{Q}_i}P(z^j_k|x^T_k)dx^T_k
	%\end{align*}\normalsize
	%\small\begin{align*}
	%K_i=1/\int P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k-1})P(z^i_k|x^T_k)\prod\limits_{j\in\mathcal{Q}_i}P(z^j_k|x^T_k)dx^T_k
	%\end{align*}\normalsize
	\small\begin{align*}
		%K_i=1/\int P^i_{pdf}(x^T_k|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})P(\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k|x^T_k)dx^T_k
		K_i=1/\int P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k-1})\prod\limits_{z^j_{k^i_j}\in \mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k}P(z^j_{k^i_j}|x^T)dx^T,
	\end{align*}\normalsize
	and $P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})$ is called posterior individual PDF; $P(z^j_{k^i_j}|x^T)$ is the likelihood function of observation $z^j_{k^i_j}$, described in \Cref{eqn:bin_sensor1} and \Cref{eqn:bin_sensor0}.
	Note that the factorization of $P(\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k|x^T)$ in \Cref{eqn:bayes_upd} results from the conditional independence of observations by different UGVs given the position of the target.
	
	%Utilizing the conditional independence property of observations, $P(\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k|x^T)$ can be further factorized:
	%\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}
	%P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{i}_{1:k})=K_iP^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{i}_{1:k-1})\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}P(z^j_{k^i_j}|x^T)
	%\end{equation}\normalsize
	
	
	
	
	%\todohere{merge this section with previous one}
	%\subsection{Algorithm of LIFO-DBF for Static Target}\label{subsec:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar} 
	
	%This section derives the LIFO-DBF algorithm for localizing a static target. 
	%Each UGV stores last-step individual PDF, i.e., $P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{i}_{1:k-1})$. 
	%According to \Cref{cor2}, $\mathbf{z}^i_k=\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_k$ and $\mathbf{z}^{i}_{1:k}=\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_{1:k}=\left[ z^1_{1:k^i_1},\dots,z^N_{1:k^i_N}\right]$.
	%The assumption of static target can simplify the Bayesian filter as the prediction step becomes unnecessary. 
	%Therefore, the $i^\text{th}$ individual PDF is only updated by 
	%\small\begin{align}\label{eqn:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}

	%\subsection{Algorithm of LIFO-DBF for Moving Target}\label{subsec:LIFO-dbf-mov-tar}
	%This section derives the LIFO-DBF for localizing a moving target.

	\subsection{Proof of Consistency and Consensus}\label{sec:consist_proof}
	%This section proves consistency and consensus of LIFO-DBF. 
	%Only proofs for localizing static target are presented, including static UGVs and moving UGVs.
	%The proof of LIFO-DBF for moving target is similar to that of static target by considering the dynamic model of the target, but with more complicated algebraic manipulation. 
	
	%Considering $S$ is finite and $x^{T^*}$ is the true location of target, define an \textit{equivalent-location} set $X^T_{eq}\subseteq S$ such that 
	%\small\begin{equation*}
	%X^T_{eq}=\left\lbrace x^T\in S\arrowvert P(z_k|x^{T})=P(z_k|x^{T^*}),\; \forall z_k\in \left\lbrace 0,1\right\rbrace\right\rbrace ,
	%\end{equation*}\normalsize
	%i.e., $x^T\in X^T_{eq}$ gives the same observation likelihood as $x^{T^*}$ for given UGV positions.
	%%for any two parameters in $X^T_{eq}$, the sensor model with one of these two parameters generates equivalent probability value for the same observation $z_k$
	%Since $S$ is finite, $X^T_{eq}$ is also finite.

	%
	%%\todohere{double check if the following examples for equi-parameter set are accurate}
	%
	%%\begin{rem}
	%%	the equivalent-location set depends on the property of the sensor. 
	%%	For example, for a laser scanner with high-fidelity sensing capability, each equivalent-location set contains only a small number of target positions.
	%	The reason to introduce equivalent-location set is that ghost target might exist in some special UGV arrangement and sensor types.
	%	For example, for undirected binary sensors that are linearly arranged, a ghost target can exist at the mirror position of the true target.
	%	When sensors are overlapped at a single point, ghost targets can exist on a circle that contains the true target.
	%	In theory, DBF cannot rule out ghost targets in such cases and prior knowledge is needed for further clarification.
	%%	Therefore, this study only proves the convergence to the equivalent-location set rather to the true location.
	%	However, by using high-fidelity sensors, such as cameras and laser scanners, and multiple observations from different UGV placements, equi-location set can be reduced to only contain true location of target.

%	results of LIFO-DBF under the condition of the interaction topology described in \cref{prop1}.
	To be specific, considering $S$ is finite and $x^{T^*}$ is the true position of target, the consistency of LIFO-DBF for static UGVs is stated as follows:

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}

	\medskip
	
	\begin{proof}	
		For the purpose of clarity, define time sets of $i^\text{th}$ UGV, $\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k},\,j\in\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace $, that contain time steps of observations by $j^\text{th}$ UGV that are contained in $\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k}$.
		According to \Cref{cor1}, it is known that the cardinality of $\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}$ has following property: \small$k-(N-1)T_u<|\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}|\leq k$\normalsize.
		Considering the conditional independence of observations given $x^T\in S$, the batch form of DBF at $k^\text{th}$ step is
		%\small\begin{subequations}
		%	\begin{align*}
		%		P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})
		%		&=P^i_{pdf}(x^T|z^1_{1:k^i_1},\dots,z^N_{1:k^i_N})\\
		%		&=\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l\in\mathbf{I^{i,j_k}}}P(z^j_l|x^T)}{\sum\limits_{x^T\in S}P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l=1}^{k^i_j}P(z^j_l|x^T)},
		%	\end{align*}
		%\end{subequations}\normalsize
		\small\begin{equation}
			P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})=\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k}}P(z^j_l|x^T)}{\sum\limits_{x^T\in S}P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k}}P(z^j_l|x^T)},
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		where $P^i_{pdf}$ is the initial individual PDF of $i^\text{th}$ UGV. 
		%\addtocounter{equation}{-1}\\
		Comparing $P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})$ with $P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})$ yields
		\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cmp}
			\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}=\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k}}P(z^j_l|x^T)}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*})\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k}}P(z^j_l|x^{T^*})}.
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		Take the logarithm of \Cref{eqn:cmp} and average it over $k$ steps:
		\scriptsize\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cmp_log}
			\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}=\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*})}+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}\frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^{i}_{j,k}}\ln\frac{P(z^j_l|x^T)}{P(z^j_l|x^{T^*})}.
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		Since $P^i_{pdf}(x^T)$ and $P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*})$ are bounded, then
		\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cmp_lim1}
			\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*})}= 0.
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		The binary observations subject to Bernoulli distribution $B(1,p_j)$, yielding
		\small\begin{equation*}
			P(z^j_l|x^T)=p^{z^j_l}_j(1-p_j)^{1-z^j_l},
		\end{equation*}\normalsize
		where $p_j=P(z^j_l=1|x^T)$. 
		Utilizing the facts: (1) $z^j_l$ are conditionally independent samples from $B(1,p_j^*)$ and (2) $k-(N-1)T_u<|\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}|\leq k$, the law of large numbers yields
		\small\begin{equation*}
			%\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}
			\frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}}z^j_l\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}p^*_j,\quad 
			%\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow\infty}
			\frac{1}{k}(|\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}|-\sum\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}}z^j_l)\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}1-p^*_j,
		\end{equation*}\normalsize
		where $p_j^*=P(z^j_l=1|x^{T^*})$ and ``$\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}$" denotes ``convergence in probability''.
		Then, 
		\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cmp_lim2}
			%\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}
			\frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{l\in\mathscr{K}^i_{j,k}}\ln\frac{P(z^j_l|x^T)}{P(z^j_l|x^{T^*})}\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}p^*_j\ln \frac{p_j}{p^*_j}+(1-p^*_j)\ln \frac{1-p_j}{1-p^*_j}.
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		Note that the right-hand side of \Cref{eqn:cmp_lim2} achieves maximum value 0 if and only if $p_j=p_j^*$. 
		Define 
		\small\begin{equation*}
			c(x^T)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}p^*_j\ln \frac{p_j}{p^*_j}+(1-p^*_j)\ln\frac{1-p_j}{1-p^*_j}.
		\end{equation*}\normalsize
		
		Considering \Cref{eqn:cmp_lim1} and \Cref{eqn:cmp_lim2}, the limit of \Cref{eqn:cmp_log} is
		\small \begin{equation}\label{eqn:lim}
			% \lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}
			\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}c(x^T).
			% \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}p^*_j\ln \frac{p_j}{p^*_j}+(1-p^*_j)\ln \frac{1-p_j}{1-p^*_j}
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		It follows from \Cref{eqn:lim} that
		\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lim2}
			\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})e^{c(x^T)k}}\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}1.
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		
		Define the set $\bar{X}^T=S\setminus \left\lbrace x^{T^*}\right\rbrace$ and $c_M=\max\limits_{x^T\in\bar{X}^T}c(x^T)$.
		
		Then $c_M<0$.
		Summing \Cref{eqn:lim2} over $\bar{X}^T$ yields
		\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lim3}
			\frac{\sum\limits_{x^T\in \bar{X}^T}P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})e^{\left[c_M-c(x^T)\right]k}}{{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}e^{c_Mk}}\overset{P}{\longrightarrow} |\bar{X}^T|,
		\end{equation}\normalsize
		where $|\bar{X}^T|$ denotes the cardinality of $\bar{X}^T$.
		Since $c_M<0$,  ${P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})}e^{c_Mk}{\longrightarrow}0$, \Cref{eqn:lim3} implies
		\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lim4}
			\sum\limits_{x^T\in \bar{X}^T}P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})e^{\left[c_M-c(x^T)\right]k}\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}0.
		\end{equation}
		
		Utilizing the relation 
		\begin{equation*}
			0\leq P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})\leq P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})e^{\left[c_M-c(x^T)\right]k},
		\end{equation*}
		it can be derived from \Cref{eqn:lim4} that
		\small\begin{equation*}
			\sum\limits_{x^T\in \bar{X}^T}P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})\overset{P}{\longrightarrow} 0.
		\end{equation*}\normalsize
		
		Therefore,

	%\subsection{Proof for moving UGVs}
%	The consistency of LIFO-DBF can also be proved for moving UGVs.
%	The difficulty of consistency proof lies in the fact that each UGV makes observations at multiple positions.
%	The main idea of the proof is to classify UGV observation positions into two disjoint sets: \textit{infinite-observation spots} that contains positions where a UGV makes infinite observations, and \textit{finite-observation spots} that contains positions where the UGV makes finite observations.
%	Due to the page limitation, we state the consistency result for moving UGVs without providing a proof for the purpose of completeness.
		
	%%, as $k\rightarrow\infty$.
	%Before stating main theorem, the following lemma is introduced.
	%\begin{lem}\label{lem1}
	%	For a set of UGVs moving within a collection of finite positions, each UGV has at least one position where infinite observations are made as $k$ tends to infinity.
	%\end{lem}
	%
	%\begin{proof}
	%Let $n^{i,k}_j$ denote the times that $i^\text{th}$ UGV visits $j^\text{th}$ position up to time $k$. Then, $\sum\limits_{j} n^{i,k}_j=k$. It is straightforward to see that $\exists n^{i,k}_j,$ such that $n^{i,k}_j\rightarrow \infty,$ as $k\rightarrow \infty$.
	%\end{proof}
	%\medskip
	%%The main theory of consistency of LIFO-DBF for moving UGVs is stated as follows:
%	\begin{thm}\label{thm:LIFO-dbf-mov-tar}
%		Considering a network of $N$ UGVs moving within a collection of finite positions under the interaction topology condition in \cref{prop1}, the estimated target position converges to the true position of target in probability using LIFO-DBF, i.e.,
%	%	the probability of estimated target position belonging to $ X^T_{eq}$ converges to one, i.e.,
%	%	the set of estimated target position of each UGV converges to $X^T_{eq}$ in probability using LIFO-DBF when the number of observations tends to infinity, i.e.,
%		\small\begin{equation*}
%			\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}P(x^T=x^{T^*}|\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_{1:k})=

%	%	where $\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k}=\left[z^1_{1:k^i_1},\dots,z^N_{1:k^i_N}\right]$.
%	%	, $\left\lbrace k_1,\dots,k_N\right\rbrace$ are the timestamps of $i^\text{th}$ UGV's latest knowledge of all UGVs' observations.

	%\begin{proof}
	%%Let $M^i\subseteq\left\lbrace 1,\dots,k_j\right\rbrace\times X^R $ denote the set of pair $(k,x^R)$ to indicate $j^\text{th}$ UGV's position at the corresponding time of observation.
	%Similar to \Cref{thm:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}, the batch form of DBF at $k^\text{th}$ step is
	%\small\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cmp2}
	%\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T|\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k})}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^{*}}|\mathbf{z}^i_{1:k})}=\frac{P^i_{pdf}(x^T)\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l=1}^{k^i_j}P(z^j_l|x^T;x^R_l)}{P^i_{pdf}(x^{T^{*}})\prod\limits_{j=1}^{N}\prod\limits_{l=1}^{k^i_j}P(z^j_l|x^{T^{*}};x^R_l)}
	%\end{equation}\normalsize

	%For each UGV, there exists at least one position where infinite observations are made as $k\rightarrow \infty$, according to \Cref{lem1}. 
	%All positions can be classified into finite-observation spots and infinite-observation spots. 
	%For the former, by referring to \Cref{eqn:lim} in proof of \Cref{thm:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}, it is easy to know that their contribution to \Cref{eqn:cmp2} is zero when $k\rightarrow \infty$.
	%Therefore, \Cref{eqn:cmp2} can be reduced to only consider infinite-observation spots, which is similar to proof of \Cref{thm:LIFO-dbf-sta-tar}.

	This section simulates two sets of dynamically changing interaction topologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFO-DBF.
	In both cases, six static UGVs, represented as one square and five stars in \cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar1} and \cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar2}, are utilized and each UGV is equipped with a binary sensor. 
	The square represents the UGV whose individual PDF is shown in the figure.
	All sensors are modeled with identical Gaussian functions \cite{bonnie2012modelling}:
	%\small\begin{align}\label{eqn:gauss_sensor}
	\small\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:gauss_sensor}
		\begin{align}
			P(z^i_k=1|x^T;x^{R,i})&=e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x^T-x^{R,i})^T{\Sigma}^{-1}(x^T-x^{R,i})},\\
			%		\exp\left\lbrace -\frac{1}{2}(x^T-x^R)^T{\Sigma}^{-1}(x^T-x^R)\right\rbrace \\
			P(z^i_k=0|x^T;x^{R,i})&=1-P(z^i_k=1|x^T;x^{R,i}).

%	The positions of six static UGVs are shown as stars and square in \cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar1} and \cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar2}.
	%Each UGV constantly receives binary observations of the target.
	The LIFO-DBF is implemented on each UGV for target localization.
%	The networked UGVs use a ring communication topology that each UGV can communicate with two fixed neighbors.
%	\cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar1} shows the estimation results of the static target. 
	After the initial observation, each UGV forms a circular individual PDF, centered at its own position.
	%\cref{fig:sta_sen_sta_tar_sing1} shows the individual PDF after initial observation for $1^\text{st}$ UGV.
	The circular PDF occurs because the Gaussian sensor model (\Cref{eqn:gauss_sensor}) only depends on the distance between UGV and target.
	As more observations are received by each UGV, the posterior individual PDF concentrates to the true location of the target, which accords with the consistency of LIFO-DBF.
	%In fact, with the Guassian sensor model (\Cref{eqn:gauss_sensor}), all positions with equal distance to a UGV belong to the same equi-parameter set of the UGV.
	%Considering the system of six UGVs located separately, the equi-parameter set that contains the actual target position only contains one element.

	\section{CONCLUSION}\label{sec:conclu}
	This paper presents a distributed Bayesian filtering (DBF) method for a network of multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under dynamically changing interaction topologies. 
	The information exchange among UGVs relies on a measurement dissemination scheme, called Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol. Different from statistics dissemination approaches that transmit posterior distributions or likelihood functions, each UGV under LIFO only sends a full communication buffer consisting of latest available measurements, which significantly reduces the transmission burden between each pair of UGVs from the order of environmental size to that of UGV number. 
	Under the condition that the union of undirected switching topologies
	%		 across some time intervals
	is connected frequently enough,
	%		 as system evolves,
	LIFO can disseminate observations over the network within finite time. The LIFO-based DBF algorithm is then derived to estimate individual posterior density function (PDF) for target localization in a static environment. The consistency of this algorithm is proved by utilizing the law of large numbers, ensuring that each individual estimate of target position converges in probability to the true value when the number of observations tends to infinity.
	
	Future work includes how to handle other types of sensors and directed interaction topologies.
	Other types of sensors may have biased observations and subject to non-Bernoulli distribution, which complicates the design and analysis of LIFO-based Bayesian filters.
	The directed interaction topologies, due to the constraint of unidirectional communication, may affect condition for the consistency and consensus of LIFO-DBF. 
	%In addition, combining LIFO-DBF with UGV motion planning is promising for more effective SAT of target.
