Comments to the author
======================

The paper proposes an MPC scheme for search & tracking that
takes into account computational constraints. The authors,
in particular, propose a sequential planning approach over
a MPC-based path planner.

The paper seems well organized and addresses an interesting
topic. At the same time, I have some suggestions for
improvement:

- some transposes are missing in vector definitions in
II.A;
- figure 1 isn't very explicative;
- in the definition of the sensing domain (II.B), the use
of target states x_{1,k}^t and x_{2,k}^t seems improper (as
you refer to a domain definition, I suggest to simply use
generic variables x_{1,k} and x_{2,k} instead);
- as subsection III.C is one of the key contributions of
the paper, I suggest to formalize the description of the
proposed algorithm;
- more space should be given to a comparison with 'myopic'
path planning solutions (e.g. in the simulation section);
- I suggest avoiding a separate appendix for the simulation
parameters;
- typos and minor comments: 'considered the similar
problem'; 'red and blue lines corresponds'; we make several
relaxation'; 'the target position is assumed to be
propagated ... the prediction' (clarify); 'afterwards in
all cases' => 'afterwards in all the considered cases';
'below certain threshold'; some bibliography entries (e.g.
title in reference [17], citation format consistency in
[2,3,8,19,21]).

Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) based
path planning approach for a nonholonomic mobile robot
pursuing a moving target. The robot is equipped with a
sensor of limited range. The MPC fully incorporates the
sensor's stochastic uncertainty modeled as Gaussian
distribution. To simplify the MPC solution, the paper
employs a two-step procedure that first generates the
reference trajectory and then uses it to solve the original
MPC. A numerical simulation is used to show the
effectiveness of the approach.

My main criticism of this work is that it completely avoids
dealing with obstacles often encountered in this type of
path planning. It only	mentions it briefly in the last
sentence of the paper's conclusions.
