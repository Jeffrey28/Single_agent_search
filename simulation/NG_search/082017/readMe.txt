the files in this folder are the edits up to 8-20-17. At this time, the KF can work, though some weird behavior happens: the robot make not direct its final sensor orientation towards the target. I don't understand why. May need to debug again later. 

After this version, the files will be cleaned a bit to remove redundant functions, and start working PF.
