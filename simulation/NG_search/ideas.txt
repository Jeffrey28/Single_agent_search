the code now only uses cvxPlanner. 

current issue:
1. in the termination condition, the computed gamma and inFOV seems to differ a lot. check what happens here.
2. The scaling of gamma seems to cause infeasibility issue. needs to fix this.
3. debug the whole program, think about using motion primitive for multiple initial guesses.
