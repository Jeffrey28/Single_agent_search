current issue:
1. make basic code work without gamma (the formulation in cvxPlanner sometimes works, sometimes not. So I think I need to use cvx to write this part to avoid the confusion caused by 'full'. Another possible issue: P is close to zero matrix, not sure if this will cause problems)
2. talk to George about stochastic MPC (where to take expectation)
