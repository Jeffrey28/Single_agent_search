current issue:
1. make basic code without gamma
2. the objective function seems hard to take expectation now. try to use the most basic version by assuming MAP.
3. think about how to compute gamma: use MAP or whole pdf. more important conceptual question: what gamma should be may depend on what measurement to assume, MAP or whole pdf?
