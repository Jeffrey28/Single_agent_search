Now the pf is there. should keep modifying so that it works under limited sensing FOV and make the planning part work (with basic version).

current issue:
1. the objective function seems hard to take expectation now. try to use the most basic version by assuming MAP. But needs to keep thinking if I can make the convexification for the problem
