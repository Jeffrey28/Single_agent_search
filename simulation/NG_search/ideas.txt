now the basic code can run. but solving the optimization problem is very hard, usually no good result. I need to think about some good ways to deal with this problem.

current issue:

1. the objective function seems hard to take expectation now. try to use the most basic version by assuming MAP. 

2. Needs to keep thinking if I can make the convexification for the problem.
